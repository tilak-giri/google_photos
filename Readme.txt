****************************Read_Me****************************


*This is my second attempt to create a webpage on my own without any tutorial.
*On this page i have tried to create a dummy clone of google photos mobile version.
*%%Reminder%% This page is not dinamic or responsive.
*I have modeled this page according to the screen ratio of my mobile phone device (Realme 8i).
*Trust me this does not look good on the desktop mode.
*I'm still trying to learn more css to make my sites more dinamic and responsive.

*This is my 3rd repo on github.
*Github is also new for me so I do not know a lot, just to push my already existing code.
*If any further improvement has been done to this code that will be pushed here.
